# Planning Your Code

If you associate programming more often than not with hours of fiddling, tweaking
and fighting to galvanize approaches found on online this chapter is for you. 

*Planning Your Code* shares a blueprint to accompany the evolution of your project
and code: start out with explorative experiments, define your interaface,
narrow down to a proof of concept and scale up. Hopefully these tipps and tricks
will help you to experience the rewarding feeling of a software project coming
together like a plan originated by Hannibal Smith.

## Documentation

First things first. Write the first bit of documentation before your first line of 
code. Documentation written with hindsight solely will always be written with the
mindset of someone who thinks the approach is easy because the issue was just solved. 
Also, the motivation the think about the problem is much lower once it's fixed. 
Hence I encourage you, to write up a bit of pseudo code to start get started.

## Explore! Write Scripts.

Get your hands dirty. Run experiments. How should the new graph look like? 
Try out things interactively. Can we read in the data correctly? Are the axes labels
large in enough? Is the color scheme suitable? 

The most important feature for their popularity in social sciences is the 
interactivity of R and Python. Both languages are interpreted, allowing to send 
commands to the interpreter line-by-line and to get a result back immediately. 
This is tremendously helpful when trying things out, but also when reading code 
written by more experienced developers. The ability to send code to the console
line by line can be very handy when trying to follow more complex statements.

## Design Your Interface

Once you know a bit more about your direction of travel, it's time to think about
how users interact with your program: Will your code just act as a storage pit of tools, 
a loose collection of commands for adhoc use? Are others using the program, too?
?  Will there be machine-to-machine interaction?
