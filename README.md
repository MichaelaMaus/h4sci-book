# Hacking for Social Sciences and the Humanities (online book)

This repository contains the source code of an online book made with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org). 
The book is written along with the course *Hacking for Social Sciences* taught at ETH Zurich and should hopefully grow 
with this course. I hope, however, the book will also work as a standalone input (i.e. w/o any lecture material.) to social sciences looking for insights into _Programming with Data_, 

Please leave your suggestions and feedback in the issue tracker of this repository!
